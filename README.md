# Flask Form Submission App

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to submit their details through a form and then displays the submitted information on a separate page.

### Features:
- **Input Form:** Users can enter their first name, last name, email, and address.
- **Data Submission:** The form uses the `POST` method to submit the data to the server.
- **Result Page:** The submitted details are displayed on a new page after the form is submitted.

### Files:
- **Index.html:** The form where users input their details.
- **Result.html:** The page displaying the submitted details.
- **Python.py:** The Flask application handling the form submission and rendering the templates.

### How to Run:
1. Install Flask by running:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```
2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python Python.py
   ```
3. Open any browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the form.
